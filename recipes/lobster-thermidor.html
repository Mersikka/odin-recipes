        <li>4 lobster tails</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced shallots</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups diced mushrooms (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cognac or brandy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp creme fraiche or heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>Cayanne pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp fine dried bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tsp freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>2 tsp melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut bottom shell of lobster tails using<br>
            kitchen shears along each side where it<br>
            meets the top shell; do not remove the<br>
            shell at this point. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over<br>
            medium-high heat. Place lobster tails cut<br>
            side down in the butter. Cook, covered,<br>
            about 3 minutes. Turn lobster tails over<br>
            (they are curved so will lean to 1 side);<br>
            cover and cook 1 minute. Lean them to the<br>
            other side; cover and cook 1 minute more. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat. Transfer lobster tails to<br>
            a bowl. Remove any shell pieces from the<br>
            skillet. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet<br>
            over medium heat; add shallots and pinch of<br>
            salt. Cook and stir until pan starts to<br>
            deglaze and shallots soften, 3 to 4<br>
            minutes. Add mushrooms; cook stir until<br>
            golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Add flour;<br>
            stir until mushrooms are coated and cook<br>
            for 2 minutes. Pour in cognac; use a<br>
            kitchen torch to flame cognac to burn off<br>
            alcohol. This will take just a few seconds.<br>
            Add milk; cook and stir until pan is<br>
            completely deglazed and milk begins to<br>
            thicken and turn bubbly, about 2 minutes.<br>
            Remove from heat. Stir in creme fraiche.<br>
            Let cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove lobster meat from the shell, leaving<br>
            top shell intact. Remove any bits of bottom<br>
            shell from the meat. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230<br>
            degrees C). Line a baking pan with crinkled<br>
            up foil. Make 4 channel-like indentations<br>
            in the foil to hold and stabilize the<br>
            lobster tails as they bake. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice lobster meat down the middle and<br>
            check for and remove any dark veins. Chop<br>
            into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer meat to a<br>
            mixing bowl. Add cooled sauce, tarragon,<br>
            pinch of salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir<br>
            gently until well blended. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide mixture among the lobster tail<br>
            shells; place in prepared foil-lined pan.<br>
            Sprinkle each lobster tail with about 1/2<br>
            teaspoon bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon<br>
            grated cheese. Drizzle melted butter on the<br>
            stuffed shells. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until nicely browned<br>
            and heated through, about 10 minutes. If<br>
            you like, you can turn on the broiler and<br>
            broil 1 minute until tops are golden and<br>
            crispy. 
        </li>
